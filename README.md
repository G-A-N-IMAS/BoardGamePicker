Comments are all in french sorry about that.
This is my first ever project, i didn't know how to code before starting this, hence the probably many issues with my codewriting.
I apologize to anyone who might take a look at my mess.
If you want to use the program though, just download the .exe file and run it, it does (to my own astonishment) work.
